This documentation is still a **Work In Progress**. Some topics have been discussed in greater depth, while others require additional clarification.

:::

**Welcome to the Antofy Documentation portal.**

## Get started

If you're looking for things you can do with Antofy, check out the [Antofy Ecosystem](https://antofy.com).

### Build on Antofy

Get started with Antofy by installing the [Antofy node](https://antofy.io), and deploying a simple DeFi app locally in [Quick Start]({{< ref "quick-start" >}}).

For in depth tutorials on the underlying aspects of the Antofy Network check out the [Developer Guide]({{< ref "quick-start" >}}) and the [Developer Resources]({{< ref "resources" >}}).

### Governance

[Validators](/docs/governance/validators/) are essential to the Antofy ecosystem.

Learn how to [stake](/docs/governance/staking/) your Antofy tokens and vote for validators. Highly technical users may also participate in validator elections to have a chance of becoming a paid block producer.


## Why Antofy?
Antofy is fast, scalable, has low transaction costs and does no wasteful mining.

Antofy chain features next-gen blockchain technology, utilizing POA (Proof of Authority), extensible EVM and state of the art cryptography.

## Introduction to the Antofy Platform
The Antofy Platform is a unified infrastructure platform based on the technical, traffic and ecological resources, and will be gradually open to the blockchain industry. It will make the construction of decentralized applications more efficient and cost-effective, and provide comprehensive empowerment in aspects of promotion, traffic, and resources. The Antofy Platform is an EVM compatible blockchain who solves the biggest problem of Dapp industry. The Antofy Platform will provide global developers with series of diverse innovative facilities and services.

## Solving market's biggest problem
Decentralized applications (Dapps) running on any blockchain contribute to the biggest use case of the blockchain industry. These Dapps are heavily sabotaged by the traditional blockchain's transaction speed. This really does not let heavy Dapps like gaming, metaverse, NFTs, etc. to function as their full potential. The traditional blockchain simply can not provide the transaction speed that they need. That is the reason why these types of Dapps can decide to move away from blockchain altogether and adopt a centralised web application approach. Our blockchain solves this problem by having a high TPS capacity using the mighty POA consensus mechanism. Apart from this, our blockchain also heavily emphasises the security of the network through the network of the validators responsible for confirming the transactions. The speed and security will create huge advantages for the Dapps, so they can carry on their innovative development in the blockchain ecosystem.

## Declaration
To empower the decentralised applications (Dapps) ecosystem

## Vision
Antofy's vision is not only to be the best public blockchain, but also to focus on the discovery and support of high-potential developers and innovative projects. Relying on the world's largest trading ecosystem, Antofy is committed to becoming the birthplace of innovative technologies and innovative businesses, and building a complete ecological loop of technology development, application promotion, and trading.

## Antofy’s Performance
TPS: 2000+
Average block interval: 3s
Consensus Mechanism
PA consensus mechanism: it has the characteristics of low transaction cost, low transaction delay, and high transaction concurrency.

The maximum number of validators supported is 21.

## Economic Model
The endogenous token on the chain is $BNI; the transactions consume $BNI as gas fee.

Miners pledge $BNI to become validator nodes. The reward of nodes is gas fee, which is distributed according to the mortgage proportion.

## Cross-Chain
Assets such as ETH, BNB and stable coins can be mapped to Antofy by an asset bridge. The realization method is to lock a certain amount of tokens on the original chain then generate a corresponding number of tokens on Antofy.

Antofy encourages developers to provide more decentralized cross-chain solution.

## Antofy Technical Characteristics
- An open and decentralized network to maintain the security of the network and assets.
- Support the programmability of EVM, the compatibility of smart contracts to reduce development or migration costs.
- Meta-transaction function: gas fee reduction, effectively reducing the cost of developers and users on the chain.
- Support cross-chain asset transfer to optimize users’ experience.

## Support Plan of Antofy

### Financial Support
- Antofy will set up a special fund to invest, support and incentivize high-potential developers.
- Antofy will launch a variety of developer activities and competitions to discover and fund potential developers.
- In order to reduce the cost of users on Antofy Dapp, the Antofy meta transaction function will reduce the gas fee of users holding $BNI in a step-wise manner.

## Traffic Support
Antofy will strongly support the development of Antofy ecosystem:

 - Provide traffic entrance for high-quality Dapp on Antofy.
- After running successfully on Antofy, high-quality projects can submit token listing application to Antofy trading platform, and can be listed on it if they meet the listing standards.

## Resource Support
- Projects or developers that have received investment and support from Antofy have not only the opportunity to get official news report, but also can apply for marketing service packages and promote their projects globally.
- High-quality projects can participate in Antofy foundation roadshows for free.
- Antofy will open up ecological resources to high-potential developers, matching the win-win cooperation between developers and our ecological partners.

## Risk Warning
All users and developers can participate in the current test environment and subsequent stages of Antofy for free, and there is no charging scenario.
All users must distinguish the test environment from the Mainnet. The assets generated in the test environment have no value. Be aware of counterfeit currency fraud.
Antofy announces authorization, promotion and other collaborations only through the official social media platform. Developers and users should check carefully to avoid losses.
Do not misread the official website (Antofy.io), and be cautious with private key phishing.
