:::caution Risks

To see the potential list of risks associated with the use of Antofy, check out the [<ins>Risks FAQ</ins>](/risk-disclosure.md) section.

:::

Antofy is the first zero-knowledge scaling solution that is **fully equivalent to an EVM**. All existing smart contracts, developer toolings and wallets work seamlessly. Antofy harnesses the power of zero-knowledge proofs in order to reduce transaction costs and massively increase throughput, all while inheriting the security of Ethereum.

Building dApps on Antofy is completely similar to Ethereum. Simply switch to the Antofy RPC and start building on a network with much higher throughput and lower fees. Antofy provides a complete EVM-like experience for Developers and Users alike. So you do not need special toolings or new wallets for building or interacting with Antofy.

:::info Reminder

You don't need special toolings or Wallets to build or interact with Antofy.

:::

Developers will be able to deploy their existing contracts to the Antofy, and Users can deposit assets from Ethereum and transact off-chain. These transactions are grouped into batches with zero-knowledge proof attesting to the validity of each transaction.

## Connecting to Antofy

In order to add the **Antofy** network to your wallet, you will need to enter the following details :

| Network | RPC URL | ChainID | Block Explorer URL |
| ------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Antofy Mainnet| `Soon` | `Soon` | `Soon` |
| Antofy Testnet | `Soon` | `Soon` | `Soon` |

#### Additional Details

- **Currency Symbol**: ETH

:::tip Quick Connect

You can **add Antofy Network to your MetaMask wallet** instantly by clicking the **Add to Wallet** button in the Wallet Suite interface.

:::

The next step is to [bridge your assets](bridge-to-antofy.md) from Ethereum &rarr; Antofy. You can use the Antofy Bridge natively built inside Antofy Wallet Suite to bridge your assets.

You can also view all available public endpoints to connect to **Antofy**.

## Deploying Smart Contracts

The development experience on Antofy is seamless and identical to Ethereum Virtual Machine. Developers on Antofy can use their existing code and toolings to deploy on Antofy with much higher throughput and lower fees.

Here is a video tutorial on **how to add Antofy Testnet to MetaMask and deploy smart contracts**:
